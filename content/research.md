**The Price of Traceability: E-Payments, Tax Compliance, and Policy** [with Burak Uras] (2026).

{{< details 
    abstract="Why do firms continue to rely on cash in economies where digital payments are widespread and electronic transaction costs are low? This paper shows that the answer lies in the interaction between payment technologies and tax enforcement. Using randomized experimental evidence from Kenyan small and medium-sized firms, we establish that the adoption of electronic payments causally increases tax compliance by raising transaction traceability. Moreover, SME survey evidence shows that tax evasion is associated with cash discounts. Motivated by these findings, we develop a microfounded general equilibrium model in which heterogeneous firms choose prices, payment acceptance, and tax evasion jointly. Cash facilitates evasion but exposes buyers to transaction risk, while electronic payments are safer yet traceable by third parties. These trade-offs generate endogenous cash discounts, selective rejection of digital payments, and coexistence of payment instruments in equilibrium. The calibrated model shows that when electronic payments are non–interest-bearing, inflation increases cash usage and tax evasion, overturning the standard prediction that inflation reduces cash use. We characterize the optimal policy mix and show that financial development, enforcement intensity, and inflation are tightly intertwined in maximizing government revenues and welfare."

**On the Distributional Effects of Monetary Shocks and Market Incompleteness** (2025).


{{< details 
    abstract="I study the transmission of distortionary monetary policy shocks under incomplete markets. Using a heterogeneous agents general equilibrium model, I demonstrate that there is a unique fundamental stationary equilibrium, where the distribution of monetary holdings mirrors productivity, but infinite non-fundamental stationary equilibria for a given monetary base in the presence of a frictionless bonds market. Only financially constrained economies return to the fundamental stationary equilibrium after an unforeseeable monetary shock that redistributes monetary holdings, with aggregate effects on output and endogenous price stickiness along the transition. Financially developed economies display smaller distortions and negligible effects on aggregate variables, but monetary shocks create hysteresis by making the consequences of idiosyncratic shocks permanent. While partial market completion enhances welfare by enabling nearly perfect risk sharing, this improvement is limited by the irreversibility of the idiosyncratic shocks. Ultimately, distributional effects are irrelevant for monetary policy transmission to aggregate variables in developed economies but critical in poorer countries."

**Business Cycles and Informal Hiring with Misallocation of Capital** (2021)

{{< details 
    abstract="The present work presents a model that explores the effects and behavior of informality along the business cycle in an economy characterized by capital misallocation. The intensive margin of informality is modelled through a size-dependent cost function and the extensive margin is modelled by following a dualistic approach to informality. The main results indicate that the intensive margin of informality gives less productive firms a competitive advantage during recessions; the elimination of informality decreases output and, overall, leads to more volatility; and both VAT and payroll taxes lead to intersectorial misallocation, but only the payroll tax leads to misallocation within the formal sector."
