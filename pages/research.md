**On the Distributional Effects of Monetary Shocks and Market Incompleteness:** A model on the dynamics in the absence of helicopter drops (2024).

<details class="research-links"> <summary> Abstract </summary> I study the transmission of distortionary monetary policy shocks in an environment with incomplete markets. Using a heterogeneous agents general equilibrium model, I demonstrate that frictionless credit markets generate infinite stationary equilibria for a given monetary base, but a unique fundamental stationary equilibrium, where the distribution of monetary holdings mirrors productivity. I also show that only financially imperfect economies return to the fundamental stationary equilibrium after an unforeseeable monetary shock that redistributes monetary holdings, with aggregate effects on output and endogenous price stickiness along the transition. In financially developed economies, the distortions are smaller, but monetary shocks create hysteresis by making the idiosyncratic shocks permanent, as well-functioning credit markets allow for nearly perfect risk sharing. As a result, while market completion enhances welfare, this improvement is limited by the irreversibility of the idiosyncratic shocks.

**Business Cycles and Informal Hiring with Misallocation of Capital** (2021)

<details> <summary> Abstract </summary> The present work presents a model that explores the effects and behavior of informality along the business cycle in an economy characterized by capital misallocation. The intensive margin of informality is modelled through a size-dependent cost function and the extensive margin is modelled by following a dualistic approach to informality. The main results indicate that the intensive margin of informality gives less productive firms a competitive advantage during recessions; the elimination of informality decreases output and, overall, leads to more volatility; and both VAT and payroll taxes lead to intersectorial misallocation, but only the payroll tax leads to misallocation within the formal sector. </details>
