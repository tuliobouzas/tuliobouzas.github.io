**On the Distributional Effects of Monetary Shocks:** A model on the dynamics in the absence of helicopter drops (2024).

<details class="research-links"> <summary> Abstract </summary> This paper aims to study the transmission of distortionary monetary policy shocks in an environment with incomplete markets by means of a heterogeneous agents general equilibrium model. It shows that the distributional effects of monetary shocks matter in the aggregate, but only in the absence of perfect risk sharing. I analytically show that there is a unique stationary equilibrium such that the distribution of monetary holdings fully reflects the productivity distribution. Then, I study the transition dynamics after an unforeseeable monetary shock that redistributes monetary holdings across agents. I begin with an economy without a credit market and, then, allow borrowing to take place. I show that only financially imperfect economies return to a stationary equilibrium that reflects differences in fundamentals between agents. These economies also display endogenous price stickiness. In financially developed economies, monetary shocks generate hysteresis in equilibrium by making the cor-
responding idiosyncratic shocks permanent. The development of well-functioning credit markets allows for nearly perfect risk sharing in consumption, but the resulting welfare improvement is limited by the irreversibility of the idiosyncratic shocks. All in all, this paper articulates a nuanced view on financial development, while still highlighting its positive net welfare effect.

**Business Cycles and Informal Hiring with Misallocation of Capital** (2021)

<details> <summary> Abstract </summary> The present work presents a model that explores the effects and behavior of informality along the business cycle in an economy characterized by capital misallocation. The intensive margin of informality is modelled through a size-dependent cost function and the extensive margin is modelled by following a dualistic approach to informality. The main results indicate that the intensive margin of informality gives less productive firms a competitive advantage during recessions; the elimination of informality decreases output and, overall, leads to more volatility; and both VAT and payroll taxes lead to intersectorial misallocation, but only the payroll tax leads to misallocation within the formal sector. </details>
