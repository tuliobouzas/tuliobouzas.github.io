## Working papers
- **On the Distributional Effects of Monetary Shocks:** A model on the dynamics in the absence of helicopter drops (2024).
    <details class="toggle-link"> <summary> Abstract </summary> This paper investigates the transmission of monetary shocks that are not carried out through helicopter drops of money. I develop a model with a cash-in-advance friction, monopolistic competition, perfect foresight, and rich heterogeneity in productivity across agents. I show that, although there is a unique stationary equilibrium that reflects differences in fundamentals between agents given a certain monetary base, any redistribution of monetary holdings is compatible with a stationary equilibrium if bond contracts are fully enforced. Then, I study the dynamics and convergence properties of an economy starting at the fundamental stationary equilibrium after an MIT monetary shock that redistributes monetary holdings. I begin with an economy without a market for bonds. Next, I allow borrowing to take place. Only in economies with financial frictions, the model confirms Friedman's argument that, in the absence of helicopter drops, the economy should slowly return to a stationary equilibrium that reflects differences in fundamentals. If bonds are present, the economy does not return to the same initial stationary equilibrium allocation if the interest rate reaches its equilibrium value.  Also, some degree of price stickiness can be produced by either 1) a gradual introduction of the new money in the bondless economy due to consumption smoothing, or 2) an urge by indebted agents to lower their prices relative to others to amortize their debt. Finally, financial development improves welfare by allowing for risk sharing and, in the form of higher access to financial markets, by reducing distortions in wealth.

## Work in progress
- **Tax Evasion and Payment Methods** [with Burak Uras] (2024). 
    <details class="toggle-link"> <summary> Abstract </summary> We present a monetary model to investigate tax evasion among heterogeneous sellers and their preferences for payment instruments (cash versus debit). Tax evasion is feasible only if buyers opt for cash transactions. Our framework incorporates: i) bank fees on debit transactions, ii) a probabilistic cost of tax evasion, which rises with seller productivity and the amount of evaded taxes, and iii) potential theft risk for cash held by buyers. Our contribution lies in allowing sellers to differentiate prices based on chosen payment methods, yielding policy-relevant insights. We first show that sellers offer greater discounts for cash transactions when cash revenue significantly impacts tax evasion. Second, equilibrium with multiple payment methods necessitates buyers receiving sufficient compensation via cash discounts to insure for the risk of cash theft. Third, in an equilibrium with multiple payment methods, sellers with the lowest tax evasion costs often opt exclusively for cash. Moreover, our framework illustrates that uncertainty regarding seller types induces buyers to hold liquidity across multiple payment instruments, resulting in an ex-post inefficiency and necessitating policy intervention.

- **Business Cycles and Informal Hiring with Misallocation of Capital** (2021)
    <details class="toggle-link"> <summary> Abstract </summary> The present work presents a model that explores the effects and behavior of informality along the business cycle in an economy characterized by capital misallocation. The intensive margin of informality is modelled through a size-dependent cost function and the extensive margin is modelled by following a dualistic approach to informality. The main results indicate that the intensive margin of informality gives less productive firms a competitive advantage during recessions; the elimination of informality decreases output and, overall, leads to more volatility; and both VAT and payroll taxes lead to intersectorial misallocation, but only the payroll tax leads to misallocation within the formal sector.
