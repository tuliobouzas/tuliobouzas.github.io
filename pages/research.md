**On the Distributional Effects of Monetary Shocks:** A model on the dynamics in the absence of helicopter drops (2024).

<details class="research-links"> <summary> Abstract </summary> This paper investigates the transmission of monetary shocks that are not carried out through helicopter drops of money. I develop a model with a cash-in-advance friction, monopolistic competition, perfect foresight, and rich heterogeneity in productivity across agents. I show that, although there is a unique stationary equilibrium that reflects differences in fundamentals between agents given a certain monetary base, any redistribution of monetary holdings is compatible with a stationary equilibrium if bond contracts are fully enforced. Then, I study the dynamics and convergence properties of an economy starting at the fundamental stationary equilibrium after an MIT monetary shock that redistributes monetary holdings. I begin with an economy without a market for bonds. Next, I allow borrowing to take place. Only in economies with financial frictions, the model confirms Friedman's argument that, in the absence of helicopter drops, the economy should slowly return to a stationary equilibrium that reflects differences in fundamentals. If bonds are present, the economy does not return to the same initial stationary equilibrium allocation if the interest rate reaches its equilibrium value. Also, some degree of price stickiness can be produced by either 1) a gradual introduction of the new money in the bondless economy due to consumption smoothing, or 2) an urge by indebted agents to lower their prices relative to others to amortize their debt. Finally, financial development improves welfare by allowing for risk sharing and, in the form of higher access to financial markets, by reducing distortions in wealth. </details>

**Business Cycles and Informal Hiring with Misallocation of Capital** (2021)

<details> <summary> Abstract </summary> The present work presents a model that explores the effects and behavior of informality along the business cycle in an economy characterized by capital misallocation. The intensive margin of informality is modelled through a size-dependent cost function and the extensive margin is modelled by following a dualistic approach to informality. The main results indicate that the intensive margin of informality gives less productive firms a competitive advantage during recessions; the elimination of informality decreases output and, overall, leads to more volatility; and both VAT and payroll taxes lead to intersectorial misallocation, but only the payroll tax leads to misallocation within the formal sector. </details>
